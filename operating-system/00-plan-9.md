Plan 9 began in the late 1980's as an attempt to have it both ways: to build a sys­tem that was centrally administered and cost-effective using cheap modern microcom­
puters as its computing elements.
The idea was to build a time-sharing system out of workstations, but in a novel way.

The problems with UNIX were too deep to fix, but some of its ideas could be brought along.
The best was its use of the file system to coordinate naming of and access to resources, even those, such as devices, not traditionally treated as files.

Instead of customizing the hardware, Plan 9 offers the ability to customize one's view of the sys­tem provided by the software.
