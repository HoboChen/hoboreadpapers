## [Frangipani: A Scalable Distributed File System](https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs422/2014/bib/thekkath97frangipani.pdf)

### Abstract & 

Frangipani is a new file system. The lower layer is Petal, a distributed storage service that provides incrementally scalable, highly available, automatically managed virtual disks.
In the upper layer, multiple machines run the same Frangipani file system code on top of a shared Petal virtual disk, using a distributed lock service to ensure coherence.
